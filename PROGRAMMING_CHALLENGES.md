# Programming Challenges Feature

This document outlines the new programming challenges feature added to the Voice Interview Agent platform.

## Overview

The platform now includes interactive programming challenges with voice integration, combining traditional coding tests with AI-powered voice coaching and feedback.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Challenge Types
- **Explain-before-code**: Voice explanation → Code implementation → Voice walkthrough
- **Voice debugging**: AI debugging coach → Code fixes
- **Code review**: Review existing code for issues
- **Black-box contract**: Implement functions to satisfy API contracts
- **Performance tuning**: Optimize code for speed and memory

### 2. User Flow
1. Browse challenges by difficulty, type, language
2. Select a challenge and view details
3. For "explain-before-code": Record voice explanation of approach
4. Write code in multi-language editor
5. Submit for automated testing
6. For applicable types: Record voice walkthrough
7. View detailed results and AI feedback

### 3. Pages Added
- `/training/challenges` - Challenge list with filters
- `/training/challenges/[slug]` - Challenge details
- `/training/challenges/[slug]/attempt` - Interactive coding environment
- `/training/challenges/[slug]/results/[submissionId]` - Results and feedback

### 4. Components Added
- `ChallengeCard.tsx` - Challenge preview cards
- Integrated with existing `Agent.tsx` for voice features

### 5. API Routes
- `/api/challenges/submit` - Handle code submissions and results

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models (TypeScript)
```typescript
interface Challenge {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  slug: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard";
  type: "explain-before-code" | "voice-debugging" | "code-review" | "black-box-contract" | "performance-tuning";
  languages: string[];
  starterCode: Record<string, string>;
  timeLimitMs: number;
  memoryLimitMB: number;
  tags: string[];
}

interface Submission {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  challengeId: string;
  language: string;
  code: string;
  status: "queued" | "running" | "passed" | "failed" | "error" | "timeout";
  score: number;
  caseResults: CaseResult[];
  transcriptId?: string;
  planTranscriptId?: string;
  walkthroughTranscriptId?: string;
}
```

### Voice Integration
- Reuses existing Vapi integration from interview features
- Custom prompts for different challenge phases:
  - Planning assistance
  - Debugging coach
  - Code walkthrough evaluation

### Code Execution
- Currently uses mock responses for demonstration
- Ready to integrate with Judge0, Piston, or custom Docker runners
- Supports multiple programming languages

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 1 (Immediate)
1. **Real Code Execution**: Integrate Judge0 or Piston API
2. **Firestore Integration**: Store challenges, submissions, progress
3. **Monaco Editor**: Replace textarea with proper code editor
4. **User Progress**: Track completion, scores, streaks

### Phase 2 (Advanced)
1. **AI Code Review**: Gemini analysis of code quality, style
2. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Personalized challenge recommendations
3. **Peer Review**: Community code review features
4. **Certificates**: Generate completion certificates
5. **Leaderboards**: Global and friends leaderboards

### Phase 3 (Premium)
1. **Custom Test Cases**: User-generated challenges
2. **Live Coaching**: Real-time AI hints and guidance
3. **Performance Analytics**: Detailed coding metrics
4. **Team Challenges**: Collaborative coding exercises

## Integration Points

### With Existing Features
- **Authentication**: Uses existing Firebase Auth
- **Voice**: Leverages Vapi integration from interviews
- **UI**: Consistent with existing design system
- **Navigation**: Added to main home page

### Database Schema (Future Firestore)
```
collections/
├── challenges/
├── submissions/
├── challengeProgress/
├── testCases/
└── planTranscripts/
```

## Development Notes

### Current Mock Data
- 5 sample challenges with different types and difficulties
- Mock submission results and AI feedback
- Ready to replace with real Firestore queries

### Styling
- Uses existing Tailwind classes and design tokens
- Responsive design matching interview pages
- Dark theme consistent with platform

### Performance
- Code editor uses textarea placeholder (easily replaceable)
- Lazy loading for challenge lists
- Optimized bundle size

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to homepage - see new "Programming Challenges" section
2. Click "View All Challenges" or individual challenge cards
3. Select a challenge and click "Start Challenge"
4. Experience the multi-phase coding workflow
5. View results with detailed feedback

The feature is fully functional for demonstration and ready for backend integration with real code execution services.
